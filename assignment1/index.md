# Assignment 1 Mock Facebook user story

## Project Overview <br>

Assume that you have used Facebook or similar photo sharing applications. Please describe the user story on uploading a photo and two use cases for that task: 1) upload from a file in the local computer; 2) upload with a hyperlink to a web image. You should make the mockup user interface screens (or copy them from the actual running Facebook app/website) to attach in each step in the use case.

## **To run: 'mkdocs serve' in terminal**
